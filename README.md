# Hi, I'm Hajar!

a computer engineering student passionate about **problem-solving with a creative twist**!  
ðŸš€ On my journey through tech, I'm diving into both **backend** and **frontend** development, exploring how to build things that are both smart and user-friendly.  
ðŸ’¡ I see every bug as a puzzle, every feature as an opportunity to learn, and every project as a chance to build something meaningful.  
Tech is my playground â€” and Iâ€™m here to learn, build, and push boundaries, one line of code at a time.
